# SUPERDARKNET
A darknet made out of an overlay network nested on top of another overlay network. Effectively having the right to be called "the third layer".

Formerly Passage - A small modification to i2p+.
This originally started as a joke to disprove wiki.ilita.i2p's claim that "shadow web domains aren't real". So I made something small to prove that everything is possible.

The feedback to this information from some was anything but positive, following the hijacking of my account and it being griefed with the note related to this repository "it's all BS, the networks are not real".

# How do you manage to get into drama even on github?
I don't know, but this time I am going all-in with expression so expect me setting a much much bigger shockwave trough culture.

# What is a "superdarknet"?
A SuperDarknet is my idea of an overlay network on top of another overlay network! It is also the 3rd communication layer of the deep web!
